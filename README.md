# Simple Tailwind Landing Page Practice

This site does not include authentication, external pages, or payments. This is simply just a landing page that I built to practice using Tailwind. It is also currently not being deployed.

Includes the following sections: Navbar, 3 hero sections (product showcase, popular products, special offer), customer reviews, subscription, and footer.
